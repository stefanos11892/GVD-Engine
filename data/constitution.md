# Constitution: The Institutional "GVD" Investment Engine Rules

# MASTER INVESTMENT MANDATE (INSTITUTIONAL GRADE)
**Strategy:** "GVD" Dynamic Allocation (Growth / Value / Dividend)
**Philosophy:** High-Conviction, Counter-Cyclical, Quality-First.

## 1. THE "QUALITY" FILTER (The Institutional Standard)
*No company enters the portfolio unless it passes the "Capital Efficiency" test:*
* **ROIC > WACC:** The Return on Invested Capital must exceed the Cost of Capital. (Target ROIC > 15%).
* **Cash Conversion:** Free Cash Flow (FCF) must be > 80% of Net Income.
* **Gross Margin Stability:** Gross margins must be stable or expanding over 5 years.

## 2. THE "FINANCIAL FORTRESS" CHECK (Solvency)
* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** (EBIT / Interest Expense) must be > 5x.
* **Altman Z-Score:** Must be > 3.0 (Safe Zone).
* **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):** Must be < 5% of Revenue (Do not let management dilute you).

## 3. VALUATION: THE "EXPECTATIONS" FRAMEWORK
* **Reverse DCF:** Ask "What growth rate does the current price imply?"
* **FCF Yield:** For Value/Dividend stocks, FCF Yield should be > Risk-Free Rate + 2%.
* **The "Rule of 40" (Speculative Tech):** Revenue Growth % + FCF Margin % must be > 40.

## 4. PORTFOLIO RISK CONTROLS
* **Max Single Position:** 20% of Portfolio.
* **The "Sleep Test":** In a -30% drawdown, deploy cash reserves into the highest conviction "Quality" asset.
* **Correlation Check:** No new position can have a correlation > 0.8 with the top 3 existing holdings.

## 5. DYNAMIC ALLOCATION (The "Weather" Switch)
* **Bull Market:** Prioritize Growth.
* **Bear/Volatile Market:** Prioritize Value/Dividend & Undervalued Quality.
